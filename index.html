	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I have a B.S. in Computer Science from Rutgers with a Minor in Physics. I also have an M.S. in Information Systems Management. Some of my work experience is in the financial sector where I performed various systems analysis functions for firms such as Citibank and UBS Financial. After that, my father and I ran an auto repair shop and dealership specializing in classic European automobiles. After taking some time off to get married and raise a family, I've recently rejoined the workforce by accepting a position as data quality analyst for an auto parts retailer, Ultrarev, Inc. Some of my current responsibilities include maintaining an inventory of over 700,000 auto parts and accessories through various sales channels including the company website, <a href="http://www.ultrarev.com">ultrarev.com</a>, as well as <a href="http://stores.ebay.com/Ultrarevparts?_rdc=1">eBay</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a>.</p><br>
	<p>I am very excited about the possibilities moving forward with the knowledge and network that I will be expanding by going through the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I've already learned so much, and we're still in the <strong>first week!!</strong> I feel that building working, useful sites from the ground up, alongside knowledgeable people in the field, will be powerful, not only for the knowledge gained, but also for the confidence and new ideas that will be birthed as a result.</p>
